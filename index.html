The initial cost of the project, when approved in 1971, was Rs. 9.61 crore, which, as of 2007, is estimated to cost Rs. 170 crores. However, the construction of the project was started in 1976 and the dam was completed in 2000, and the irrigation component is under final stages of completion having achieved an irrigation potential of 9,537 ha, as of 2007.[3][4][5].</p>

  	  <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>
